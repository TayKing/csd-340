        <p class="intro">
            My name is Taylor King. I live in Indiana near Louisville Kentucky.
            I was born and raised in this area though i have moved around a bit
            over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew up, like most I suppose, riding the bus to my local school.
            The town and the school I went to were very small and we only had about
            one hundred kids in my grade all the way up to graduation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I come from a large family, in todays standards. <span class="sentence">Our family reunions 
                were always held on the farm that my grandmothers family lived on when
                they first came to Indiana over two hundred years ago.</span> I would go every
            year to our family get togethers and though I recognized most of the faces
            I could not name even half of the people there, though I knew they were
            all family.
        </p>
        <p>
            My wife and I carry on the tradition of a big family. We have seven
            children and we are even living in the home where my grandmother raised
            my father and my uncles. It is a peaceful farm life, however the modern
            world is slowly moving in on our once quite town and it is only a matter
            of time before my home and all the memories my family has built over the 
            last several generations are soon removed to make room for more subdivisions
            and fast food restuarants.
